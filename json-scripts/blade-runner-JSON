Flecks of green\nand yellow in a field of milky blue.  Icy filaments\nsurround the undulating center.\nThe eye is brown in a tiny screen.  On the metallic\nsurface below, the words VOIGHT-KAMPFF are finely\netched.  There's a touch-light panel across the top\nand on the side of the screen, a dial that registers\nfluctuations of the iris.\nThe instrument is no bigger than a music box and sits\non a table between two men.  The man talking is big,\nlooks like an over-stuffed kid.  \"LEON\" it says on\nhis breast pocket.  He's dressed in a warehouseman's\nuniform and his pudgy hands are folded expectantly in\nhis lap.  Despite the obvious heat, he looks very cool.\nThe man facing him is lean, hollow cheeked and dressed\nin gray.  Detached and efficient, he looks like a cop\nor an accountant.  His name is HOLDEN and he's all\nbusiness, except for the sweat on his face.\nThe room is large and humid.  Rows of salvaged junk\nare stacked neatly against the walls.  Two large fans\nwhir above their heads."

Deckard stands out-\nside the entrance to an old hotel holding an umbrella,\nas people scuttle into doorways to avoid the sudden\ndownpour.\nINT. LEON'S HOTEL LOBBY - NIGHT                         13\nA heavy metal maze of cubicles and perilous iron\nbalconies, peopled with rejects from the surface world;\nMato Grosso Indians in white man's clothes and other\nlower echelon welfare recipients.  Drop city is crowded,\ncramped and darkly alive.\nDeckard steps out of an elevator and moves through the\ncrowd.  A cloud of steam drifts up through  a grating\nas two old men, clad in towels descend a flight of\nstairs under a neon sign that says bath house.\nA musty subterranean wind ripples Deckard's clothes as\nhe turns into an alcove.  He stops in front of a door\nthat says, MANAGER and pushes the buzzer.  It's opened\nby an emphysema victim with an oxygen tank lashed to\nhis hip.  Deckard flashes his ID and speaks some words\nwhich are inaudible due to the TUBA MUSIC down the hall.\nThe man grabs a key from his wall, hands it over and\nshuts the door.\nINT. LEON'S HOTEL CORRIDOR - NIGHT                      14\nThe companion ways below deck of a big ship are no\nmore bewildering than the ups and downs and ins and\nouts of this establishment.  But Deckard finds the door\nhe's looking for.  He pauses a moment, listens, then\nknocks.  He inserts the key and with a hand on his gun\nopens it.\nINT. LEON'S ROOM - NIGHT                                15\nAn empty room.  A cot and not much else.  He steps in\nand stands quiet as a hunter sensing the signs.  For a\nplace surrounded by greasy hovels it is surprisingly\nclean.  Spartan in fact.  The towel by the spotless\nbasin is perfectly folded.\nDeckard runs two fingers over a shelf.  No dust.  He\nlooks in the waste basket.  Wadded up candy wrappers.\nThe bed by the window is neatly made.  Deckard looks\nunder it, then runs his hands along both sides of the\nmattress.\nThe closet.  There's one suit in it.  He pats it down.\nNothing. A show box on the floor.  He stoops, takes\nout what looks like a pen from his pocket and care-\nfully traces it over the box.  Assured of its harm-\nlessness, he lifts off the lid.\nIt contains a little stack of photos bound with a\nrubber band.  Deckard removes them, goes to the lamp\nby the balcony window and turns it on.\nA touching collection of family snapshots.  The kind of\nanonymous stuff sold by the bunch in dusty junk shops.\nThe family dog.  Junior on the pony squinting in the\nsun.  Uncle Ben clowning with the kids.  The faded\npolaroid of Christmas morning.  Simple pictures of\nsimple folks celebrating the family bond.  A curious\ncollection for the likes of Leon and Deckard studies\nthem with interest.\nEXT. STREET BELOW - NIGHT                               16\nOblivious to the cloudburst, a blue-eyed albino stands\nin the doorway, peddling candy and artificial flowers\nlooking like he'd never been touched by the light of\nday.\nLeon is standing behind him, staring up at his room,\nwatching Deckard at the window.  He's still wearing\nhis coveralls, but he looks different.  His face is\nmore intent, smarter and angry.\nEXT. STREET BELOW - NIGHT                               17\nFor one seething moment it looks like Leon might mash\nsomething, but suddenly he swings away and disappears\ninto the crowd.\nINT. LEON'S ROOM - NIGHT                                18\nDeckard pockets the pictures and moves away from the\nwindow.\nEXT. ALLEY - NIGHT                                      19\nLeon's got a neck like a fire hydrant and legs to\nmatch, but he's a graceful runner.  Looks like he could\ndo it for days.  And he could.  He's put a lot of alley\nbehind him and he's not out of breath.\nEXT. CHINATOWN - NIGHT                                  20\nSlowing down he cuts into an opening and comes out onto\na narrow street.  The Asian Quarter.\nINT. CHOP SUEY HOUSE - NIGHT                            21\nA seamy as well as steamy little place.  Counter and\nsmall tables.  Old slant-eyed enders humped over their\nfuming bowls jabbering and slurping.\nThe only voice coming out clear is from the big three-\nD TV on the back wall.  As the mellow-mouthed TV\nannouncer delivers the message, a Latin-looking beauty\nin a well-fitted maids uniform does a twirl, flashes\na beguiling smile and glides OUT OF FRAME."

Nobody there, just silence.\nHe comes closer to the building and stands in the sha-\ndows off to one side of the entry.\nHis head jerks up to the SOUND OF CRASHING GLASS.\nSebastian comes hurtling down and explodes into the\npavement thirty feet below.\nDeckard's eyes move up the line of descent, the shat-\ntered window on the next-to-top floor.\nINT. SEBASTIAN'S APARTMENT LOBBY - NIGHT                96\nNot much to see, But Deckard misses none of it as he\ncrosses the floor and positions himself in the spot of\nleast exposure.  He looks around.  Elevator and stair-\nwell.\nClose to the wall, he moves towards the elevator, keep-\ning an eye on the stairwell door.\nStepping to one side, he hits the button.  The elevator\ndoor slides open.  He reaches in, presses a button and\nas the doors slide shut, Deckard slips a pen between\nthe doors, jamming the operation.\nDeckard's shoes and soundless as he quickly crosses the\nlobby floor.  He pauses a moment in front of the stair-\nwell door, then pushes it open and:\nINT. STAIRWELL, SEBASTIAN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT           97\nSteps into the dark on the other side.  Suddenly he\nspins, dropping to the floor, and FIRES three times in-\nto the figure hovering to his left.\nThe man is hanging off the floor, his arms locked into\nthe railing, neck broken -- with three holes in his\nchest... but he was already dead.\nDeckard stares at the corpse.  It's Mr. Deetchum, the\nold watchman.  That RUSTLING SOUND are rats who were\nfeeding on him, scampering for safer places, Deckard\ngets to his feet.\nThe stairway rectangles ten stories up.  As his foot\ntouches the first step, a raw, terrified SCREAM shatters\nthe air.  It came from below.  It's the cry of a young\ngirl -- it GROWS TO A PIERCING SHRIEK AND ABRUPTLY\nSTOPS.  Deckard ejects the half-used cartridge from his\nlaser, inserts a fresh one and quiet as the silence,\ndescends the basement stairs.\nINT. BASEMENT - NIGHT                                   98\nAt the bottom he faces a corridor.  The FAINT HUM OF\nMACHINERY comes from the double doors at the far end.\nThe HUM BECOMES A RATTLE by the time he gets there.\nEach door is fitted with a small window.  Deckard\nsteps to the side and peers through.\nINT. GYM - NIGHT                                        99\nIt's a gym.  The mirror-lined walls are cracked and\ntarnished, the equipment atrophied from lack of use.\nThe heavier barbells have sunk into the floor.  Two\nweight-reducing machines are flapping and grinding away\nlike idiots.  Deckard's eyes stop on the woman.\nShe dangles a few feet off the floor, hung by the\nshoulders through rings suspended from the ceiling.\nHer head is slung forward, her body limp and slightly\nswaying.\nDeckard pushes open one of the doors until it touches\nthe wall.  Slowly, he advances toward the hanging figure,\nkeeping an eye on the mirror to cover surprises from the\ndoor.  He's not breathing hard.  His heart isn't pound-\ning.  Deckard's in his element.\nClose enough to look up into her face, he stops.  It\nisn't grisly death that causes the reaction in his\neyes.  It's the innocence of her angel face.\nIt's not something he has time to consider.  In the\nmirror behind him, he sees the door starting to open.\nDeckard spins.  He shouldn't have.  Pris' legs snap up,\ncrack the laser out of his hand and clamp around his\nneck.\nSlowly, the door swings closed, but Deckard doesn't\nnotice.  His carotid artery is no longer sending blood\nto the brain.  He jerks up his foot and reaches down.\nAs his fingers close around the ankle laser, Pris'\nfingers close around his wrist.  Deckard's hand opens\nlike a flower.  The laser drops to the floor as his\neyes roll back into his head."

He's propelled fifteen feet across the\nroom, slams into a machine and falls to the floor.\nPris flies off the rings and comes at him.\nDeckard reaches out to pull himself up, but she's al-\nready there.  Not too hard and just in the right place,\nshe kicks him in the stomach.  He goes back to the\nfloor, gagging for air.  Oh-so-precisely she reaches\nout with a long index finger and flips the switch on\nthe machine.\nIt's a flab eliminator with a vibrator belt.  Normally\nan innocuous piece of equipment, but the motor housing\non this one is missing.  Lots of GRINDING METAL.  A\nbad place for flesh and bone.\nBut that's where Deckard's hand is going.  An eight-\nyear-old against a full-down man.  In two more seconds\nhis hand will be ground round.  Deckard tries to pull\nhis hand loose.  It won't come.  He yanks hard, but\nit's welded in hers.\nHis face is twisted and strained as he raises a leg,\nwedges his foot against her chest and pushes with all\nhis might.  The hold breaks.  They topple back.  Deckard\nhits the floor gulping to catch his breath.  Pris is up\nand coming for him again.  She hovers over him.  Deckard\nrolls out of the way as she comes down like a pile\ndriver.\nReflexively Deckard raises his arm to protect himself.\nPris just smiles, takes hold of his foot and drags him\nacross the floor.  She doesn't like to leave a piece of\nwork unfinished.  They're going back to the machine.\nHe goes by a weight-stand of dumbbells and grabs hold.\nIt doesn't stop him.  He's sliding over the floor like\nit was ice, weight stand in tow.\nPris gets to the machine, yanks his foot up and forces\nit toward the opening.  Deckard sits up, a five-pound\ndumbbell in his hand, and clobbers her in the back.  It\nknocks her off balance, but she doesn't let go of his\nfoot.  She hooks out with a fist but misses.  He gets\nher with a roundhouse in the face.\nShe goes to the floor and Deckard's up, the dumbbell\nover his head, coming down with it.  Fighting for her\nlife now, Pris drives a foot into his chest.  It lifts\nhim off the floor.  He flies back across the gym and\nlands in a heap.\nNo more games.  Pris is furious and moving fast.  She\nrips a steel bar out of the wall and, holding it over-\nhead, charges him like a samurai.  As she comes down\nfor the kill, she freezes.\nDeckard landed near the laser.  He crawls towards it.\nAs in a nightmare, it takes forever.  But he gets there.\nHe reaches out and grabs the laser, rolls over and\ntakes careful aim.  She charges towards him, screaming\nher rage.  He FIRES as she comes.\nThe shot amputates her left arm at the shoulder, but\nher hand doesn't let go of the bar.  It dangles crazily\nin front of her as she charges forward.\nHe PUTS THE NEXT ONE through her neck.  Pris hiccups a\nrope of blood as she flies through the air and crashes\nnext to Deckard.  Dead.\nHe lies next to her, chest heaving.  Slowly he rolls\nover and gets to his hands and knees.  Panting, he stag-\ngers to his feet and stands over her, swaying slightly.\nThe sound that escapes his throat is raspy and dry.  It\nmight not sound like a war cry, but it is.\nINT. CORRIDOR - NIGHT                                   100\nLaser in hand, Deckard kicks open the swinging doors\nand walks into the corridor, a dangerous man.\nINT. STAIRWELL - NIGHT                                  101\nDeckard arrives at the main floor landing, checks his\nloads and continues up the stairs.  He's going to shoot\nthe next thing that moves and find out later if he was\nright or wrong.\nINT. STAIRWELL - SECOND FLOOR - NIGHT                   101A\nOn the next landing he throws the door open.  His eyes\nmove down the hall, looking for prints in the dust.\nNone.  He continues up the stairs.\nINT. NINTH FLOOR - NIGHT                                102\nOn the ninth floor he finds what he's looking for.\nFootprints coming and going from a door halfway down the\nhall.  He stops to the side of it and listens.  Silence.\nDeckard FIRES three quick shots through the door.  If\nsomebody were on the other side of it, they aren't now.\nHe kicks the door open and dives through head first\nand hits the floor in a roll, POURING FIRE into the\nfar corners of the room but the room is empty.  There's\na kitchen bar, a closet and a bedroom door, both\nclosed.  Deckard's breathing is the only sound.  No\nresponse from either door.\nMaybe it was a sound, maybe intuition, but suddenly\nDeckard twists around and FIRES several shots into the\ncloset.  The smouldering door slowly creaks open.\nMary is huddled in the rear of the closet.  Her hand\nout like somebody about to catch a ball but afraid of\nit.  In her other hand she clutches a button-eyed\nmonkey.  Her face is bewildered, frozen in fear, her\nbody riddled with holes.  No recognition gap here.\nDeckard SHOOTS her through the neck to make sure.  Mary\nfalls to the floor, like a puppet with her strings cut.\nDeckard backs away from the pathetic figure in the\ncloset and sits on the sofa, unable to take his eyes\noff her.\nDeckard lays the laser down next to him, holds out his\nhand and looks at it.  It's steady.  He drops it in\nhis lap, closes his eyes and leans back.\nA TAPPING from the ceiling.  Deckard looks up.\nA KNOCK -- with the proverbial DOUBLE RAP at the end.\nA pause.  Deckard jumps out of the way as the ceiling\ngives in.  Chucks on concrete and plaster hit the\ncouch where he was sitting.  The hole is a couple feet\nin diameter -- beams cracked through, exposing the\napartment above.  Silence.  Deckard wipes the plaster\ndust from his eyes and mouth, then whispers:"

Batty falls\nlike he was poleaxed, hits the floor dead weight.\nDeckard starts to tremble.  His arms go limp as his\nhead tilts back and he closes his eyes.  He can breathe\nagain.\nOn the floor, Batty's hand is crawling toward Deckard's\nankle.\nWith the unsuspected abruptness of a man slipping on a\nbanana peel, Deckard comes down.  Face knotted in hor-\nror, he EMPTIES THE LASER in Batty's body -- but the\nhand holds on.  With a screech of frustration he drops\nthe laser and like an animal claws at Batty's dead\nfingers -- but the fingers are welded shut.\nDeckard starts to crawl, pulling Batty behind him.

TENTH FLOOR STAIRWELL - NIGHT                      119\nGroaning, he tugs and pulls, hauls and heaves Batty's\nbody to the edge of the landing.  He pauses for breath,\nthen lays back, wedging his feet against Batty's shoul-\nders and pushes.  Inch by inch the body goes over the\nedge.  Then all at once it drops.  But the hand holds\nand the weight of the body takes Deckard with it.  As\nDeckard slides over the edge, he grabs hold of the\nrailing.\nDeckard's hanging three hundred feet over the basement\nfloor, supporting himself and Batty's corpse -- almost\nfour hundred pounds of stress on his fingers.\nWith his free foot he chops away at Batty's hand, try-\ning to break it loose.  But it's not working.  Deckard's\nfingers are starting to slip.\nHis face is a mask of agony as he wedges his heel over\nBatty's thumb.  With the help of gravity and everything\nhe's got in his right leg to push with, he pushes.  The\nthumb breaks loose.  Batty falls.\nThe SOUND OF HIS BODY HITTING BELOW sounds good, but\nDeckard doesn't notice.  He's in an awkward position.\nHe must reverse the way he's facing to pull himself up.\nHe lets go with his right hand and crosses it over the\nleft.  Then turns the left around so he's got an over-\nhand grip.\nLike a man doing his last pull-up... the one that can't\nbe done, Deckard pulls himself up, throws a foot over\nthe edge and grapples and heaves and wiggled himself\nonto the cold solid steel of the stairwell landing.\nAnd lies there, body jerking spasmodically, slowly\nclenching and unclenching his cramped hand, but it's\nhis burning cheek against the cool metal he's most aware\nof.\nDizzy, hot, lungs on fire, he stands -- and putting one\nfoot in front of the other, Deckard descends the stairs.\nEXT. SEBASTIAN'S BUILDING - DAWN                        120\nSlowly the door pushes open and Deckard comes out into\nthe morning.  The sun isn't yet risen, but the sky has\nbegun to pale.  It's a brooding gray stew of a dawn not\nvery pretty, but even though he can't show it, Deckard\nis glad to see it.\nFor a moment he tilts his head back and takes some\nbreath, then walks across the courtyard towards the\nstreet, so dead on his feet he hasn't the energy to\nfall.\nDeckard slumps into the shelter of his car.  The col-\nlapses on the front seat.\nINT. DECKARD'S BEDROOM - DAWN                           121\nIn a corner of the dimness Deckard sits slumped on a\nchair, facing the pearly gray light of the window.  The\nonly SOUND in the room is the soft steady BREATHING\nthat comes from the bed.\nQuietly he gets up and walks over to her.  Rachael lies\nsleeping, one delicate arm exposed from under the sheet.\nDeckard stands there, bettered and grim, staring down\nat her.\nMoments go by and finally he sits gently on the edge of\nthe bed.\nRachael opens her eyes, and looks up at him, she smiles.\nEXT.
